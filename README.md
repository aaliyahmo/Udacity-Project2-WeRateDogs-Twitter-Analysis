## Udacity-Project2-WeRateDogs-Twitter-Analysis

This is my second project with Udacity for the Data Analyst Nanodegree. 

## Intro
The dataset that I would be wrangling and analyzing is the tweet archive of Twitter user @dog_rates, also known as WeRateDogs. WeRateDogs is a Twitter account that rates people's dogs with a humorous comment about the dog.

These ratings almost always have a denominator of 10. The numerators, also almost always greater than 10. Example: 11/10, 12/10, 13/10, etc.

WeRateDogs downloaded their Twitter archive and sent it to Udacity via email exclusively for the students to use in this project. This archive contains basic tweet data (tweet ID, timestamp, text, etc.) for all 5000+ of their tweets as they stood on August 1, 2017.

Udacity also provided a image prediction file, of the top 3 predictions of the dogs associated with the image of each tweet.

Additional data such as favourites and retweets information on each tweet was downloaded via Tweepy (twitter api) through a twitter developer account that I had to make.

There were 9 quality and 4 tidiness issues found.

Dataset is in folder.
